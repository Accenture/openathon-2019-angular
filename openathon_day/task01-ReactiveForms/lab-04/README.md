# Lab 04 - Services
## Objectives and Outcomes

In this lab we are going to introduce an important concept: *Services*. This will lead us to other features as:

* Dependency Injection.
* Get data from an API. 
* An introduction to Observables.
* Manage environment variables.


## Services and Dependency Injection

A service is a class that **you want** to share across components. Usually a service is defined in a file apart and isn't associated with any specific view. As other Angular main elements, the service is annotated by a TypeScript decorator named *@Injectable*. A service should have a specific job and do it well.

Examples of services would be fetching data from server, console logs, validations... these tasks can be shared by several components and can be delegated to services to alleviate the workload of the components and to not repeat code (remember *DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself*).

To use a service inside a component you have to inject it. This injection is done by the *Angular Dependency Injection framework*. The *Dependency Injection* is not an Angular Concept but a well-known design pattern to increase the efficiency and modularity.

To use this mechanism in Angular you have to do like next:

* Create the service with @Injectable annotation.
* Declare the service in a Module inside an object named *providers*. This way Angular knows how to obtain the service class itself.
* Inject the service inside the desired component by declaring it as a parameter in the *constructor* function.
* Now, you can use it as it if were part of the component (as a constant, function... it depends what the service returns).

</p>

> **_Side Note:_**  A dependency doesn't have to be a serviceâ€”it could be a function, for example, or a value.

It's time to create our first service. We are going to create one to fetch our events data. This service will be used in the views that need it. In our case *event-list.component*, since this is the view that currently shows the event list.

## Event service

The final proposal for this service is to fetch the data from an API REST managed by our backend. The backend is the objective of Openathon V therefore we are going to get our data from a *.json* file to mimic the API request but from our own service.

As we've said, our service has to be imported by a module, so we will create a separate module to import it (and all future services). This module, of course, have to be imported by main app module too to be part of the whole app... so:

```sh
ng g module core
ng g service core/event
```

This will create a *core* folder and the service file, *event.service.ts*. We've named the module as *core* following the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#overall-structural-guidelines" target="_blank">Angular Style Guide</a>.

Now, paste this code to the *event.service.ts* file:

```javascript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root"
})
export class EventService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getEvents(): Observable<any> {
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    });

    return this.http.get("assets/events.json", { headers });
  }
}
```

There are some interesting things in this code. Let's analyse it slowly.


### Imports

As you know, we have to annotate the class by @Injectable typescript annotation, so we have to import it before. Now, Angular knows that this class is an injectable service.

Also, since we are going to get data from our backend (mocked as a .json file) we need to use the HttpClient service responsible for making the request over the HTTP protocol. We also imported HttpHeaders becase we will need to add some simple headers later like (*"application/json"*).

The third import is a class form the *RxJS* library and it need a little introduction.



### Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript (RxJS)

*RxJS* itself is out-of-scope for this guide but you need some understanding to grasp the Angular way of managing some features.

An Observable, as described in the official documentation, is the most basic building block of RxJS library that represents an event emitter, which can deliver multiple values of any type (literals, messages, or events, depending on the context). 

The *Observable* emits sequences of events which can be heard from anywhere in the app. To do this, the component where we want to use those events must *subscribe* (*.subscribe()*) as a *Observer*.  The *Observable* object, by itself, will not cause a network event to be fired unless it is being listened, so by calling *.subscribe()* (this we will see further) on the Observable, you're essentially attaching a listener to the emitter.

> **_Side Note:_**  The Rx pattern is based on the combination of the Observer and Iterator patterns. You can learn more about RxJS <a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview" target="_black">here</a>.

Angular use this patter through RxJS library in several features, one of them is HttpClient which produce and consume RxJS Observables.



### getEvents Observable

Our getEvents method returns the result of a "get" method from the HttpClient service. This returns an Observable and we need to type it as Observable (*Observable\<any\>*). When another part of the app consumes this method *getEvents*, what it will consume is an Observable, so it will have to subscribe to it. Note: we need to inject the HttpClient (renaming it as http) since it is a Service. This service is hosted by *@angular/common/http* module.

In the *get* method we set up two parameters: the route to our .json file (our API endpoint in the future) and the headers (a simple header to inform that we want a json data type).


## Consume the Event service

We already have our service that is getting the data from our backend... well, we still need to create the json file, but our service does its job. Now we want to use it in the *event-list.component* witch is the component that is showing the events list. Let's do it. The new *event-list.component.ts* looks like:

```javascript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { Event } from "../../models/event";

import { EventService } from "../../core/event.service";

@Component({
  selector: "oevents-event-list",
  templateUrl: "./event-list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./event-list.component.scss"]
})
export class EventListComponent implements OnInit {
  events: Event[];
  selectedEvent: Event;

  constructor(private eventService: EventService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getEvents();
  }

  onSelectEvent(event: Event) {
    this.selectedEvent = event;
  }

  getEvents() {
    this.eventService.getEvents().subscribe((events: Event[]) => {
      this.events = events;
      this.selectedEvent = events[0];
    });
  }
}
```

We've deleted the hardcoded events array (now they will come from our .json file witch emulates the API data). After that, we have imported our new service *EventService* and injected it through the constructor naming it *eventService*.

To use it, we create a new method *getEvents* and inside of it we call the method "getEvents* of the Service (remember we called *getEvents" our method in *event-list.component.ts*). Note that we need to subscribe to it because it returns an Observable. Now we run the Observable by calling the method in *ngOnInit()* (this method is started when the component is created... we will learn more about it later). The Observable returns us the data from .json file (shaped as the *events* parameter typed with TypeScript as Event model). With the data fetched, we assign them to the *events* variable and we select the first one to be showed in the view (event-list.component.ts).

## The ending details

Two more details are required to have the service working. First, create the .json file and second, register the new service allowing the app to know about it.

Create a new file *events.json* in the *assets* folder with next content (it have to be a well-formed json):

  }
]
```

Now, import the service in the *core.module.ts* file:

```javascript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";

import { EventService } from "./event.service";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [CommonModule, HttpClientModule],
  providers: [EventService]
})
export class CoreModule {}
```

Note that we need the HttpClientModule in the *imports* object since this is the  module where resides *HttpClient* and *HttpHeaders* we are using in the service.

> **_Side Note:_**  Remember, we need to import all Angular modules needed in our app module or feature modules so their class, interfaces... can be imported into our components.

An important detail is that we need to put the service in the *providers* array. This is because the provider tells Angular how to obtain a value for a dependency (and services are dependencies after all). There is more about providers, but we will leave it for now as they are more advanced concepts.

Now, we will register the core module in the main app.module.ts where we always must have all things we want to use in the app.

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

// Modules
import { CoreModule } from "./core/core.module"; // <--- NEW
import { SharedModule } from "./shared/shared.module";
import { AppRoutingModule } from "./app-routing.module";
import { EventsModule } from "./events/events.module";
import { LoginModule } from "./login/login.module";
import { ProfileModule } from "./profile/profile.module";

// Components
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { LandingPageComponent } from "./landing-page/landing-page.component";
import { ToolbarComponent } from "./toolbar/toolbar.component";
import { PageNotFoundComponent } from "./page-not-found/page-not-found.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    LandingPageComponent,
    ToolbarComponent,
    PageNotFoundComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    CoreModule, // <--- NEW
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    SharedModule,
    EventsModule,
    LoginModule,
    ProfileModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Transform data from HttpClient

In a real app we will need to manage the data that HttpClient service bring us from the API. Perhaps we need to transform the format or to handle errors (highly recommended).

Since the data is provided by an Observable, we need *RxJS* tools to manage it. This data comes in form of a data stream, that is, a sequence of data elements made available over time. Realize that the stream is the subject which is being observed (data from API), and the observer subscribes to it and waits for data arrival... a data stream!

> **_Side Note:_**  Streams are very well known structures in *Node* world and other contexts. You can deeply learn from a lot of blogs and webpages, like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API" target="_black">here</a> or <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html" target="_black">here</a>.

In order to work with streams, RxJS library offers a lot of operators (their learning is out of the scope in this lab), but you can think on them as functions to manage arrays in other contexts. There are operators like **filter**, **map**, **concat***... that transform and operate with the data returned by the Observable in a declarative and chaining way.

In our *event.service.ts* file we have:

```javascript
...
return this.http.get(environment.apiURL, { headers }).pipe(
      retry(3),
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
...
```

We can see two operators piped: *retry* (to try again if an error occurs in the request) and *catchError* (to manage errors). This last operator sends the error to a method (*handleError*) where we will process it. If there isn't any error, the *get* method (and the *getEvents* method) returns the results from the API to our method (named *getEvents* too) in the component.

### Environments management

In the last code showed you can see that we changed our *assets/events.json* where we're consuming the data from: *environment.apiURL*.  This variable has the same value (*assets/events.json*) but we're getting it from the*environment* file located in *environments/environment*. If we're in a development environment, Angular will get the *apiURL* value from the *environment.ts* file, but if the environment is production, Angular will choose the value from *environmet.prod.ts* file. This way, we can to set up different variables depending of the environments we have.

At the end, and adding the *handleError* method earlier mentioned to manage errors (you can see the comments in this method to know what it is doing), the *event.service.ts* will be:

```javascript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import {
  HttpClient,
  HttpErrorResponse,
  HttpHeaders
} from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable, throwError } from "rxjs";
import { catchError, retry } from "rxjs/operators";
import { environment } from "../../environments/environment";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root"
})
export class EventService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getEvents(): Observable<any> {
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    });

    return this.http.get(environment.apiURL, { headers }).pipe(
      retry(3),
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
  }

  // Error handling

  private handleError(error: HttpErrorResponse) {
    if (error.error instanceof ErrorEvent) {
      // A client-side or network error occurred. Handle it accordingly.
      console.error("An error occurred:", error.error.message);
    } else {
      // The backend returned an unsuccessful response code.
      // The response body may contain clues about what went wrong,
      console.error(
        `Backend returned code ${error.status}, ` + `body was: ${error.error}`
      );
    }
    // return an observable with a user-facing error message
    return throwError("Something bad happened; please try again later.");
  }
}
```

> **_Side Note:_**  There are a lot of operators as you can see in <a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/operators" target="_blank">the documentation</a>. 


##JSON-Server
JSON-server gives us a very simple way to create a REST API server. It is a *Node* module we can install globally. Run the following code in your terminal:

```sh
npm install json-server -g 
```
* Configure the json-server. Choose one location in your computer and create a new folder called 'json-server'. Then go to this 
 <a href="./db.json">Download db.json file </a> and move it into the folder that we just have created. 
 
* Open the command line and go into the json-server folder. Now we are going to run our server with the following command: 

```sh
	json-server --watch db.json
```

<p>
    <img src="./resources/jsonServerRunning.png">
</p>

<br/>

> **_Side Note:_** 
By default, the server will start at port number 3000. If you wish to change the port number, you can do it with the '-p' parameter.
```sh
	json-server -p3004 --watch db.json
```


Once our server is running, we should be able to access to our database data through the following address:

http://localhost:3000/events



## Adding the API Url 
Now that we have our server running, we have to make some changes in our code. First letâ€™s change the environment.ts file and add the new API URL.

```javascript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiURL: "http://localhost:3000/"
};
```

In event.service.ts let's change the API call.
```javascript
  getEvents(): Observable<any> {
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    });

    return this.http.get(environment.apiURL + "events", { headers }).pipe(
      retry(3),
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
  }
```

Save all the changes, the application should display now the event data.
