</p>

You are welcome to a new **Openathon** edition organized for the
**Accenture Technology Custom Software  Engineering** where, once
again, we will have the opportunity to discover, in a practical way,
the possibilities offered by the different architectures and leading
frameworks in the market.

## The target application: Open Events

**Open Events** is a solution that will allow us to register and retrieve the different technology events that are interesting for the **CSE Communities**. 

The **Frontend component** will be developed using **Angular**. We are going to learn step by step during the next laboratories not only Angular theory but general **Architecture Good Practises** and **Main Principles**.

We will finish with a fully working Webapp using mocked data waiting for the solution **Backend** counterpart that will be the subject for the **V Openathon**.

Once **Open Events** solution is finished, it will be published as a tool for **CSE Communities** activities.


**Open Events** functionalities :

* Landing page: Intro and description. Shortcuts.
* Menu
  * Home
  * Events
    * See events
      * List (with filters as last, location…)
      * Event page selected with details
    * Find events (filters)
    * Create event (with categories)
    * Delete event
    * Edit event
    * Your events (as organizer)
  * Login-Register
    * Register page
